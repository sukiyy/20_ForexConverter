### Comments

See conceptual.md for feedback on your conceptual questions.

- Good use of client side validation
- Good use of exception handling and reflecting that back to the user for when an invalid currency is inputted
- Clean, concise server code
- Separating out the GET and POST methods does make for an easier read / more maintainable code, instead of combining them like you did.
- App looks clean!
